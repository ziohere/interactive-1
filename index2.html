        This week’s election will likely mark another milestone in the
        partitioning of America into divergent and increasingly hostile blocs of
        red and blue states. From New Jersey and Virginia to California, Tuesday’s
        results are poised to extend a process that has allowed each party to
        consolidate political control over a huge swath of the country and that is
        heightening conflict among the states to a degree unmatched since the
        civil rights era in the 1960s — if not, the Civil War a century before
        that. This week’s voting could further this separation in two distinct
        ways. Democratic victories in the governor’s races in Virginia and New
        Jersey would continue the trend of Democrats winning most elected offices
        in the states that typically go blue in presidential elections — while the
        inverse is increasingly true for Republicans in typically red states. Even
        more important, though, this week’s vote will almost certainly accelerate
        the redistricting war that threatens to uproot one of the last beachheads
        for both parties in the geographic area dominated by the other. Following
        moves by Texas and other Republican-controlled states to eliminate
        Democratic House seats, the near-certain passage of Proposition 50 in
        California to erase up to five GOP-held seats will escalate the
        redistricting arms race between the parties. As that struggle unfolds
        across the country, it is likely to doom a substantial share of the
        remaining House members from each party in states that usually vote the
        other way for president.
